# GraphQL + Neo4j Demo / Tooling Exploration
I made this repo to explore GraphQL and graphing databases.

# Database
I used [the Neo4j sandbox's](https://neo4j.com/sandbox-v2/#) `GraphConnect 2018 Schedule` image.  It has a graph of conference Sessions, Speakers, etc.

# Demo
The [GraphQL API](https://boiling-hollows-82728.herokuapp.com/) is deployed to a Heroku instance.

# Tools
- Project generated with [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli)
