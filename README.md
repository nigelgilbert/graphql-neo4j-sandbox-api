# GraphQL + Neo4j Demo / Tooling Exploration
I made this repo to explore GraphQL and graphing databases.

## Goal
- Learn about Graphing databases and GraphQL
- Get 3rd party data from this GraphQL server into an Arc component from the [Arc tutorial](https://dmn.arcpublishing.com/alc/arc-products/pagebuilder/fusion/documentation/recipes/fetching-content.md)

## Database
I used [the Neo4j sandbox's](https://neo4j.com/sandbox-v2/#) `GraphConnect 2018 Schedule` image.  It has a graph of conference Sessions, Speakers, etc.

## Demo
The [GraphQL API](https://boiling-hollows-82728.herokuapp.com/) is deployed to a Heroku instance.

## Tools
- Project generated with [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli) (which is awesome)

## HTTP Example Usage
